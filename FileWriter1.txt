BufferedInputStream is used to read data from an underlying InputStream (e.g., FileInputStream) in a more efficient manner by using a buffer.
read(): Reads a single byte of data from the stream.
read(byte[] b): Reads an array of bytes into a buffer.
available(): Returns the number of bytes that can be read without blocking.
skip(long n): Skips over n bytes of data.
close(): Closes the stream and releases resources.
BufferedOutputStream is used to write data to an underlying OutputStream (e.g., FileOutputStream) in a more efficient manner by using a buffer.
write(int b): Writes a single byte of data to the stream.
write(byte[] b): Writes an array of bytes to the stream.
flush(): Forces any buffered data to be written to the underlying stream.
